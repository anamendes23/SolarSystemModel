# Solar System Model

This project was built as part of the Coursera course "Game Design and
Development 1: 2D Shooter" by Michigan State University. You can find the
course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-design-and-development-1).

In addition to the course work, I added:
* scaled the astronomical objects to represent their real sizes and distances;
* the planets orbit the sun with an elliptical path;
* the orbit speeds are scaled, but mainted the real proportions to real speed.

## Topics covered

This project was made in Unity, and it went over the following topics:
* Materials
* Lighting
* Behavior, scripting
